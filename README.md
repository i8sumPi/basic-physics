# Basic Physics
My basic 2d physics engine with everything you need for JavaScript games.

Creating your own physics for a JavaScript game can be a lot of work, 
and real physics engines can be really complicated, 
so unless you are trying to create very realistic physics simulations, 
my basic physics engine will be perfect for you!

It has everything you need for most games, for example platformers or angry birds.

# Features
1. Gravity
2. Collision detection between moving objects and static objects
3. Realistic bouncing
4. Spinning

# Limitations
1. Does not support moving objects bouncing against other moving objects
2. Moving objects must be generally circle/square shaped
